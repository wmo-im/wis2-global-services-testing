=== Global Cache Service testing

==== Functional Tests

===== MQTT Connectivity

====== Purpose
An MQTT client must be able to connect to the local broker of the Global Cache on port 8883 using the MQTT protocol version 5 with TLS (i.e., mqtts protocol) and username/password authentication.
*Source:* Manual on WIS (WMO No. 1060), Vol II, clause 3.7.5.2: A Global Cache shall operate a message broker.

====== Steps

. Initialize the MQTT client with the necessary parameters such as the MQTT protocol version 5, TLS security, and username/password for authentication.
. Attempt to connect the MQTT client to the local broker of the Global Cache on port 8883.
. Check if the connection is successful. If the connection is successful, the test passes. If the connection is not successful, the test fails.
. Close the connection to the broker after the test.

===== Client subscription

====== Purpose
A Global Cache must allow connected MQTT clients to subscribe to the cache/a/wis2/# topic.

====== Steps

. Initialize the MQTT client with the necessary parameters such as the MQTT protocol version 5, TLS security, and username/password for authentication.
. Connect the MQTT client to the local broker of the Global Cache.
. Once the connection is successful, attempt to subscribe to the `cache/a/wis2/#` topic.
. Check if the subscription is successful. If the subscription is successful, the test passes. If the subscription is not successful, the test fails.
. Close the connection to the broker after the test.

===== Global Broker subscription

====== Purpose
A Global Cache must connect to at least 2 Global Brokers using the MQTT protocol with TLS and username/password authentication (everyone/everyone) and subscribe to the following topics:

* ``++origin/a/wis2/+/metadata/#++``
* ``++origin/a/wis2/+/data/core/#++``
* ``++cache/a/wis2/+/metadata/#++``
* ``++cache/a/wis2/+/data/core/#++``

====== Steps

. Initialize the GC with the necessary parameters such as the MQTT protocol version 5, TLS security, and username/password for authentication for the connection to both GB as well as the subscription information to the listed topics. The specific means to achieve this depends on the implementation of the GC

. Connect the GC as described above to the Global Brokers.
. Verify that the connection is established by either the Log Files of the GC, the Log Files of the GB or by inspecting network traffic whichever seems fit.
. Check if the subscription is successful. Do this by
.. For each listed topic and each listed GB publish one matching WNM
.. Verify if each WNM is received by the GC. Do this by either inspectng the Log Files of the GC or by verification if the GC is trying to open a connection to the URL listed as canonical in the WNM.
. If all messages are received, the test passes. If not, the test fails.
. Close the connections to the brokers after the test.

===== Notification processing

====== Purpose
The intention here is to test that the GC functions as expected under normal conditions. The Global Cache should be able to process an incoming notification message, download the data at the canonical link, validate the integrity of the message, publish a new notification message on the proper topic using the proper message structure, and update the necessary metrics. This case/test assumes the data object and included checksum is valid, a separate test is included to test the integrity check.

The cache notification message published by the Global Cache should be identical to the notification message received, except for the following:

* the canonical link (a link object's `href` property where `rel=canonical`)
* the unique identifier of the message (id)
* the topic (`cache/a/wis2/...`) (note the incoming message may be on this same topic if it is from another GC)

The notification messages will follow the standard structure (see Manual on WIS (WMO-No. 1060), Volume II, Appendix E: WIS2 Notification Message).

The notification messages will be published on the standard topic structure in their local message brokers (see Manual on WIS (WMO-No. 1060), Volume II, Appendix D: WIS2 Topic Hierarchy) on topic `cache/a/wis2/...`.

On successful completion, the following metrics should be modified:

* `wmo_wis2_gc_download_total` should be incremented by 1 (one).
* `wmo_wis2_gc_dataserver_status_flag` for the source data server (i.e., the centre ID from where the data item was downloaded from) should be set to 1 (one).
* `wmo-wis2_gc_dataserver_last_download_timestamp_seconds` for the source data server should be set to the current time.

====== Steps

These tests rely on mock data and/or curated batches of real data. Specifically notification messages, with accompanying data objects, whose characteristics are known and can be used to validate the GC's behavior.
Upon processing the batch of notification messages, the following will be evaluated and compared against the expected results:

* The total number of cache notification messages published by the GC
* The total number of data objects cached by the GC
* The validity of the notification messages published by the GC
* The validity of the data objects cached by the GC (i.e., the data object is accessible via the canonical link)
* The following metrics are updated (or not) as expected per the curated test data set:
  ** `wmo_wis2_gc_download_total`
  ** `wmo_wis2_gc_dataserver_status_flag`
  ** `wmo_wis2_gc_dataserver_last_download_timestamp_seconds`

===== Cache false directive

====== Purpose
Where a Global Cache receives a notification message with _properties.cache_ set to false, the Global Cache should publish a notification message where the data download link (a link object's `href` property where `rel=canonical`) refers to the source data server.

The cache notification message published by the Global Cache should be identical to the notification message received, except for the following:

* the unique identifier of the message (id)
* the topic (`cache/a/wis2/...`) (note the incoming message may be on this same topic if it is from another GC)
----
Is the above assessment correct?
----

===== Steps

These tests rely on mock data and/or curated batches of real data. Specifically notification messages, with accompanying data objects, whose characteristics are known and can be used to validate the GC's behavior. In this case a known number of messages will have the cache directive set to false.
Upon processing the batch of notification messages, the following will be evaluated and compared against the expected results:

* The total number of cache notification messages published by the GC
* The total number of data objects cached by the GC
* The validity of the notification messages published by the GC, taking into consideration the bullets above (difference between the original and the published message).
* The following metrics are updated (or not) as expected per the curated test data set:
  ** `wmo_wis2_gc_download_total`
  ** `wmo_wis2_gc_dataserver_status_flag`
  ** `wmo_wis2_gc_dataserver_last_download_timestamp_seconds`
  ** `wmo_wis2_gc_no_cache_total` (incremented by 1 for each notification message where the cache directive is set to false)

wmo_wis2_gc_no_cache_total is a proposed new metric

===== Source download failure

====== Purpose
Where a Global Cache is unable to download a data item from the location specified in a notification message (i.e., the source data server), the `metric wmo_wis2_gc_dataserver_status_flag` for the source data server should be set to 0 (zero).

===== Steps

. step 1
. step 2

===== Cache override

====== Purpose
Where a Global Cache determines that it is unable to cache a data item, the Global Cache should publish a notification message where the data download link (a link object's `href` property where `rel=canonical`) refers to the source data server, and the metric `wmo_wis2_gc_cache_override_total` is incremented by 1 (one).

More details needed about the notification message; format, content, topic.

===== Steps

. step 1
. step 2

===== Data integrity failure check

====== Purpose
Where a notification message provides an integrity value for a data item (`properties.integrity`), a Global Cache should validate the integrity of the resources it caches and only accept data which matches. A Global Cache should calculate the hash of the data object instance [once downloaded into the cache?] using the method specified in `properties.integrity.method`. Where the calculated hash does not match the value specified in `properties.integrity.value`:
The data item should be removed from the cache if already downloaded
No notification message should be published
The `metric wmo_wis2_gc_download_errors_total` should be incremented by 1 (one).
The `metric wmo_wis2_gc_integrity_failed_total` should be incremented by 1 (one).

===== Steps

. step 1
. step 2

===== Duplicate notification discarding

====== Purpose
A Global Cache must ensure that only one instance of a notification message with a given unique identifier (id) is successfully processed.

Test this by sending two identical notification messages, ideally from different sources, and verify that the second notification message is discarded.

*Source:* Manual on WIS (WMO No. 1060), Vol II, clause 3.7.5.3: A Global Cache shall subscribe to notifications about the availability of discovery metadata records and core data for real-time or near-real-time exchange. Duplicate notifications are discarded.

===== Steps

. step 1
. step 2

===== Duplicate notification discarding (alternative)

====== Purpose
Where a Global Cache fails to process a notification message with a given unique identifier (id), a Global Cache must attempt to process subsequently received notification messages with the same unique identifier.

Test this by sending two almost identical notification messages, the first of which should include an unresolvable data download link (a link object's `href` property where `rel=canonical`) (or simply missing a `canonical` link object?). This will force processing of the first message to fail. The second notification message should be processed successfully, with the data item being copied into the cache.

===== Steps

. step 1
. step 2

===== Duplicate data discarding

====== Purpose
A Global Cache must ensure that only one instance of a data item, designated with a given unique identifier (`properties.data_id`) and publication time (`properties.pubtime`) in the associated notification message, is successfully processed.

Test this by sending two notification messages each with a unique identifier (id) but both with the same data identifier (`properties.data_id`) and publication time (`properties.pubtime`). Ideally the notification messages should simulate data being made available at different locations (i.e., an origin WIS2 Node and another Global Cache) with differing data download links (a link object's `href` property where `rel=canonical`).

===== Steps

. step 1
. step 2

===== Duplicate data discarding (alternative 1)

====== Purpose
Where a Global Cache fails to process a notification message relating to a given unique data object (`properties.data_id` + `properties.pubtime`), a Global Cache must attempt to process subsequently received notification messages with the same unique data identifier.

Test this by sending two notification messages each with a unique identifier (id) but both with the same data identifier (`properties.data_id`). The first message should include an unresolvable data download link (a link object's `href` property where `rel=canonical`) (or simply missing a `canonical` link object?). This will force processing of the first message to fail. The second notification message should be processed successfully, with the data item being copied into the cache.

===== Steps

. step 1
. step 2

===== Duplicate data discarding (alternative 2)

====== Purpose
A Global Cache should treat notification messages with the same data item identifier (`properties.data_id`), but different publication times (`properties.pubtime`) as unique data items. Data items with the same `properties.data_id` but a later publication time should be copied into the cache (see test Notification processing). Data items with the same `properties.data_id` but earlier or identical publication times should be ignored (see test Duplicate link discarding).

[Test this by sending several notification messages with varying pubtimes and determine which are successfully uploaded]

===== Steps

. step 1
. step 2

===== Client data download

====== Purpose
An HTTP client (i.e., a Web browser) must be able to connect to the HTTP server of the Global Cache on port 443 using HTTP 1.1 with TLS but without any authentication and be able to resolve the URL provided in a data download link (a link object's `href` property where `rel=canonical`) from a notification message published by the Global Cache within the previous 24 hours; i.e., download a cached data item.

Note: testing provision of access via HTTP 1.1 - “at least one of the protocols”.

==== Considerations

===== General Testing Strategy

The testing strategy for the Global Cache (GC) will leverage both mocked data and curated real data. This approach ensures a comprehensive evaluation of the GC's functionality under various scenarios.

1. **Mocked Data:** This data is artificially created to simulate specific scenarios that might not be easily reproducible with real data. It allows us to test edge cases, error conditions, and unusual data patterns.

2. **Curated Real Data:** This data is derived from actual use cases and provides a realistic representation of what the GC will encounter in a production environment. It allows us to test the GC's performance and reliability.

The testing process will be automated through scripts. These scripts will perform the following steps:

1. **Data Publication:** The scripts will publish a batch of messages to the dev MQTT broker. These messages will represent a mix of scenarios based on the mocked and curated real data.

2. **GC Subscription:** The GC will be subscribed to the MQTT broker to receive the published messages. This simulates the GC's real-world operation where it subscribes to Global Brokers to receive notifications. (Remy has something already in the works here)

3. **Result Validation:** After the GC processes the received messages, the scripts will validate the results. This includes checking if the GC correctly stored the data, published notifications, and updated metrics as expected.

===== General Performance Testing Strategy

The performance testing strategy for the GC will primarily focus on the time taken from when a notification message is published to when the associated cache message is received by the test process. This approach ensures a comprehensive evaluation of the GC's performance under various scenarios.

1. **Notification Publication:** The test process will publish a notification message to the MQTT broker. This message will represent a specific scenario based on the mocked or curated real data.

2. **Start Timer:** The test process will start a timer immediately after the notification message is published. Multiple timers can be used for multiple notification messages.

3. **GC Subscription and Processing:** The GC, which is subscribed to the dev MQTT broker, will receive the published notification message. It will then process the message, which may include storing the data, publishing a cache notification, and updating metrics as expected.

4. **Cache Message Receipt:** The test process, which is also subscribed to the MQTT broker, will receive the cache message published by the GC.

5. **Stop Timer:** The test process will stop the timer immediately after the cache message is received.

6. **Result Validation:** The test process will validate the results. This includes checking if the GC correctly processed the notification message and published the cache message, and if the time taken (as measured by the timer) is within the acceptable performance limits.

7. **Data Size Consideration:** The size of the cached data objects will also be considered. The performance of the GC can be evaluated based on the bytes per second processed. This will help in understanding the GC's efficiency in handling different sizes of data objects.


===== Addition of `wmo_wis2_gc_no_cache_total` metric
* This metric will be used to capture `properties.cache=false` cases. It will be incremented by 1 (one) for each notification message where the `properties.cache` property is set to `false` or where the Global Cache determines that it is unable to cache a data item.

===== Message uniqueness = `properties.data_id` + `properties.pubtime`
* The unique identifier of a data item is a combination of the data identifier (`properties.data_id`) and the publication time (`properties.pubtime`). This is to ensure that the Global Cache does not store multiple copies of the same data item AND to support the ability to update/correct data items.

* Are other folks in agreement with this approach and already implementing it?

===== Max data object size
* What is the maximum size of a data object that a Global Cache should be able to process and store?

===== Data Integrity Checks
* How are folks implementing the data integrity check? Downloading first or any other approach, perhaps a rolling hash?

===== Best practices/best effort
====== Retry/Redrive strategy
* Simple: failed download attempts where we retry same URL. (immediate, and/or after a backoff as these solve different problems).
* Redrive based on messages with redundant `properties.data_id`'s in the event of a download failure. This would require caching all messages for a certain amount of time. This way the Global Cache can reprocess the message with the same `properties.data_id` + `properties.pubtime` if the download fails and 'redundant' messages with different download links exist.
    ** supporting update/correction of data items per GTS?
