=== Global Broker Service testing

All Global Services, and in particular Global Brokers and Global Caches, are collectively responsible in making the WIS a reliable and efficient mean to exchange
data required for the operations of all WIS Centres. The agreed architecture provides a redundant solution where the failure of one component will not impact the overall level of service of WIS.  Each Global Service should aim at achieving at least 99.5% availability of the service they propose. This is not a contractual target. It should be considered by the entity providing the Global Service as a guideline when designing and operating the Global Service.

A Global Broker:

- should support a minimum of *200* WIS2 Nodes or Global Services
- should support a minimum of *1000* subscribers.
- should support processing of a minimum of *10000* messages per second

==== Functional tests

===== 1. Global Broker Connectivity Tests

There are several test that can be performed on the Global Broker in advance of the planned GB testing period (currently scheduled for September 30 - October 4).
A. to D. below can be performed any time.

====== A. Global Broker Port Tests

====== Purpose

An MQTT client must be able to connect to the local broker of the Global Broker on ports 8883 (MQTTS) or 443 (WSS) using the agreed protocols with Transport Layer Security (TLS) and username/password authentication. 

====== Requirements

* Global Broker MQTT details.
* MQTT Test Client

====== Steps

. Initialise the test MQTT client with the necessary parameters such as the MQTT protocol, TLS security, and username/password for authentication (connection string).
. Attempt to connect the MQTT broker of the Global Broker using the connection string.

====== Evaluate

. Check if the connection is successful.

====== B. Global Broker Certificate Test

====== Purpose

The Global Broker service must use a valid certificate.  Transport Layer Security (TLS) is an encryption protocol that provides secure connections between servers and applications on the internet.

====== Requirements

* Global Broker MQTT connection string
* MQTT Test Client (If used, MQTT Explorer needs to import the Certificate Authority used by the Global Broker to check that the certificate is valid) or a browser like Firefox.

====== Steps

From the client and try to connect to a Global Broker using WSS protocol.  The Global Broker sends the MQTT client its TLS certificate.  The MQTT client then verifies that the certificate is valid and digitally signed by a trusted CA by comparing it with information it stores about trusted CAs. The signed certificate verifies the website server’s public key, which confirms that you’re communicating with the genuine server of the website you’re visiting.  The server also authenticates a key exchange, resulting in a one-time session key that is used to send encrypted and authenticated data between the clients and the server.
If a browser like Firefox is used, connect WSS endpoint (https://globalbroker.example.org/mqtt). In the address bar, a lock is displayed.

====== Evaluate

. Check if the TLS connection is successful 
. Check for certification verification.

If the connection is successful and the certificate are valid, the test passes. If the connection is not successful or the certificate is invalid, the test fails.

====== C. Global Broker Origin and Cache Read-Access Test

====== Purpose

The Global Broker service must allow [.underline]#only# read access to _origin/a/wis2/#_ and _cache/a/wis2/#_ using a username and password credential of everyone/everyone 

====== Requirements

* Global Broker MQTT connection string
* MQTT Test Client

====== Steps

. From a MQTT client, set up a new connection to the Global Broker, with the following configuration settings:   
. Configure 2 subscriptions.  First, create separate subscriptions for _origin/a/wis2/#_ and _cache/a/wis2/#_ using a username and password credential for "everyone/everyone"
. Save the configuration and click connect

====== Evaluate

Check if the connection is successful, and depending on the flow of messages, messages should appear rapidly.  If messages are displayed, the test passes. If the connection is not successful, the test fails.

====== D. Global Broker deny write access to _origin/a/wis2/#_ and _cache/a/wis2/#_ for everyone/everyone credentials Test

====== Purpose

The Global Broker service must prevent write access to any topic with everyone/everyone credentials 

====== Requirements

* Global Broker MQTT connection string
* MQTT Test Client

====== Steps

. Use an MQTT client to connect to Global Broker
. Try to publish data or metadata to Global Broker

====== Evaluate

Check if the connection is successful, and the publication fails or the connection drops, the test is successful. If the connection is successful, and the publication is allowed, the test fails.

====== E. Global Broker cluster redundancy Test

====== Purpose

The Global Broker service, should be using a MQTT server deployed in a cluster, then the MQTT Broker must use a redundant load balancing service so that the service in maintained in case of failure of one entity of the cluster 

====== Requirements

* Global Broker MQTT connection string
* MQTT Test Client

====== Steps

. From a MQTT client, set up a new subscription to either "origin/a/wis2/" and "cache/a/wis2/" using a username and password credential for "everyone/everyone".  
. Fail a member of the cluster and ensure that subscriptions are still being fulfilled

====== Evaluate

. Check if the subscription is successful even after the members of the cluster are failed. If the subscription continues as cluster is altered, the test passes. If the subscription is not fulfilled after cluster alternation, the test fails.

===== 2. Global Broker Antiloop Testing

The antiloop feature of a Global Broker is a critical aspect of WIS2 Architecture. This is what guarantees a high level of service while preventing “messages storm”.  These tests are designed to test the antiloop feature of the Global Broker service.  This must be fully functional for each WIS2 Global Broker properly prior WIS2 going to an operational state on January 1st, 2025.
If configurable, and when applicable, the Global Broker should discard incorrect WIS2 Notification Messages, by opposition of only verifying the correctness.

====== A. Discarding of duplicate messages Test

====== Purpose

The Global Broker service must discard all duplicated messages (identical id) received whatever the originator of the messages 

====== Requirements

* The container https://hub.docker.com/r/golfvert/fakewis2node deployed on 10 tests system (*io-wis2dev-11-test* to *io-wis2dev-20-test*)
* Global Broker MQTT connection string to 2 WIS2 Nodes (with the following centre_id: io-wis2dev-11-test and io-wis2dev-12-test)
* MQTT Test Client subscribed to *origin/a/wis2/io-wis2dev-11-test/#* and *origin/a/wis2/io-wis2dev-20-test/*

====== Steps

. WIS2Node _io-wis2dev-11-test_ publish on its local broker *ten* messages with a pre-defined id (using the UUID format) on topic *origin/a/wis2/io-wis2dev-11-test/core/data/weather/surface-based-observation/synop*
. WIS2Node _io-wis2dev-12-test_ publish *ten* message with the same id (same id as above) on topic *origin/a/io-wis2dev-12-test/core/data/weather/surface-based-observation/synop*  

====== Evaluate

. If the Global Broker discards all messages except one, makes it available on one of the two topics depending the WIS2 Node messages that arrived first.
. The MQTT client received one message
. Increments *wmo_wis2_gb_messages_subscribed_total* by 10 on both centre_id
. Increments *wmo_wis2_gb_messages_published_total* by 1 on centre_id from the WIS2Node that arrives first (io-wis2dev-11-test or io-wis2dev-12-test)
. If both statements are true, the test passes. Otherwise, the test fails.

====== B. Publishing a message using the centre_id from a different WIS2 Node Test

====== Purpose

The Global Broker service must ensure that any WIS2 Node is not publishing a message using a centre_id from another WIS2 Node

* MQTT Test Client

====== Steps

. Have WIS2Node  _io-wis2dev-11-test_ publish a valid message on topic Eg

====== Evaluate

. The Global Broker ignores (in fact the message will not be received at all) the message published. No metrics is incremented
. If the message is received by MQTT Client then the test fails.

====== C. Publishing messages from a WIS2 Node using valid topics (compliant with WIS2 Topic Hierarchy) Test

====== Purpose

The Global Broker service must forward messages when the topic is compliant with the WIS2 Topic Hierarchy

. The MQTT client receives all messages
. Increments *wmo_wis2_gb_messages_subscribed_total* by 1 for each message 
. Increments *wmo_wis2_gb_messages_published_total* by 1 for each message
. If all above statements are true, the test passes. Otherwise, the test fails.

. Increments *wmo_wis2_gb_messages_subscribed_total* by 10
. Increments *wmo_wis2_gb_messages_invalid_topic_total* by 10
. If all above statements are true, the test passes. Otherwise, the test fails.

====== E. Publishes messages from a WIS2 Node on a _valid_ topic without corresponding metadata Test

====== Purpose

The Global Broker service must check that the topic used to publish a message by a WIS2 Node is announcing the availability of data with corresponding metadata.

====== Requirements

===== 3. Global Broker Performance Testing

We must ensure that the Global Broker service performs properly under stress.  The following outlined tests will test the Global Broker service prior to transition of WIS2 to an operational state on January 1, 2025

====== A. Global Broker minimum number of WIS2 Nodes Test

====== Purpose

The Global Broker service should support a minimum of *200* WIS2 Nodes

====== Requirements

. The container https://hub.docker.com/r/golfvert/benchmarkwis2gb deployed on 5 tests system
. Global Broker subscribing to *200* WIS2 Nodes (*io-wis2dev-100-test* to *io-wis2dev-299-test*) 
. MQTT Test Client

====== Steps

. On each of the 200 WIS2 Nodes, publish 10 *valid* messages, on *valid* topic, without associated metadata, and with different *id* messages
. On the MQTT test client, subscribe to *origin/a/wis2/#*

====== Evaluate

. If on the MQTT test client, 10 messages for each of the 200 centre-id are received, the test passes. Otherwise, it fails.

====== B. Global Broker minimum number of subscribers Test

====== Purpose

The Global Broker service should support a minimum of *1000* subscribers.

====== Requirements

* Global Broker
* MQTTX CLI (https://mqttx.app/docs/cli) deployed on 5 tests systems

====== Steps

. Use MQTTX CLI _bench_ on each test system to simulate 200 clients by using `mqttx bench conn -c 200 -i 100` and the relevant connection information for the Global Broker being tested.

====== Evaluate

. If the output of the command on each test system is similar to:

```
mqttx bench conn -c 200 -i 100
❯  Starting connect benchmark, connections: 200, req interval: 100ms
✔  [200/200] - Connected
✔  Created 200 connections in 22.355s
```

with 200 connections created, on the 5 tests systems, this test is successful.

====== C. Global Broker minimum number of messages per second Test

====== Purpose

The Global Broker service should support processing of a minimum of *10000* messages per second.

====== Requirements

. The container https://hub.docker.com/r/golfvert/benchmarkwis2gb deployed on 5 tests system (different from above) 
. Global Broker subscribing to *200* WIS2 Nodes (*io-wis2dev-100-test* to *io-wis2dev-299-test*) 
. MQTTX CLI deployed on 5 tests systems.

====== Steps

. On each of the 200 WIS2 Nodes, publish X *valid* messages per second during Y seconds, on a *valid* topic, without associated metadata or data, and with different *id* messages
. Use MQTTX CLI _bench_ on each test VMs to simulate Z clients by using `mqttx bench sub -c Z -t origin/a/wis2/#` and the relevant connection information for the Global Broker being tested.

Typically with:

. With X = 5 messages per second on each of the 200 WIS2 Nodes, this will create 1000 messages per second
. With Z = 2 on each VM, this will create 10 subscriptions. 
. As every subscriber will get all messages will be equivalent to *10000* messages per second.

====== Evaluate

. Run the test for 30 seconds (Y=30), if MQTTS CLI output shows that 300000 are received, then the test is successful.
