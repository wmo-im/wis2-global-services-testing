=== GTS-to-WIS2 Gateway testing

No formal (e.g., automated) testing is required for the GTS-to-WIS2 Gateway.

Each WIS Centre seeking to decommission its GTS Message Switch must check that all the bulletins they normally receive via GTS are available from at least one GTS-to-WIS2 Gateway.

Each GISC should work with RTHs to validate that everything their affiliated centres are producing on GTS are available from each Gateway. 

[sidebar]
The assessment of the GTS bulletins being pubished via the GTS-to-WIS2 Gateways should be completed between 1-Jan-2025 and 31-Mar-2025.

In summary, we propose to use “user” feedback to determine veracity and completeness of data published by each Gateway. 

Performance testing is not required because each GTS-to-WIS2 Gateway has already demonstrated sustained throughput of bulletins to messages and data from GTS into WIS2.
